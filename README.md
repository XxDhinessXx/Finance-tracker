# Finance Tracker

This is a simple Python app to help you track your finances. You can:

- Add and view transactions
- Set and view budgets
- Set and check savings goals
- Visualize your spending with charts

All your data is saved in a local database. You can also clear all data if needed.

Note:
- When running the program for the first time, see to it that the first command you run is the CLEAR ALL DATA command, this is to do exactly what it sounds like because for some reason the .db files come with pre-existing data when I add them to the repository

The app stands out for its simplicity and the ability to visualize your spending using pie and bar charts. The more transactions you add, the more accurate your visualizations will be.

Development is ongoing, with plans to improve the GUI to make the app more user-friendly. Further updates will add more features as I continue to learn and improve the project.
