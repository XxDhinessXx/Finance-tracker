Finance Tracker Project Roadmap

Overview:
A personal finance tracker for your CV (Post 16 Computer Science) that helps users record transactions, categorize expenses, track income, set budgets, monitor savings, and visualize financial data. The goal is to provide both a simple CLI and a user-friendly GUI.

Core Features:
- Record income and expenses (with date, description, category, amount)
- Categorize transactions (e.g., Food, Rent, Utilities, Savings, Income, Other)
- Set and view budgets for categories
- Track savings goals and progress
- Visualize spending (pie and bar charts)
- Store all data in a local database (sqlite3)
- Clear all data if needed

Technologies:
- Python
- sqlite3 (database)
- matplotlib (visualizations)
- pandas (optional, for advanced data analysis)
- tkinter (for GUI)
- flask (optional, for future web app)

Current Status:
- CLI version: Fully functional for all features
- GUI: Basic, currently only supports visualization

What is remaining?
- A proper app-like feel with a full GUI, as the current terminal version is functional but not user-friendly enough for an "application" experience.

Decomposition / Next Steps:
1. Design the full GUI using tkinter
2. Integrate all features (transactions, budgets, savings, visualization, data clearing) into the GUI
3. Ensure smooth backend linking so data flows correctly between GUI and database
4. Add advanced features (optional): export to CSV/Excel, recurring transactions, reports, user authentication

Order of Steps:
1. tkinter design
2. Feature integration
3. Backend linking
4. Advanced features and polish

What do we already have?
- Modular codebase (transactions, budgets, savings, visualization, database)
- CLI for all core features
- Basic GUI for visualizations

What’s left?
- Full-featured GUI for the entire application
- Improved user experience and polish
- Optional advanced features and export options

This roadmap will help guide further development and make your project stand out on your CV. Good luck with your finance tracker application!
